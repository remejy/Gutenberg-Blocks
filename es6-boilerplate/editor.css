/**
 * editor.css
 * 
 * Place styles for the block that are unique to editor mode.
 * All common styles for the block in either edit or view mode should
 * be stored in style.css
 *
 * Example of style for edit only mode might be a highlight for fields
 * with a :focus
 * This would make sense in edit mode, but not while block is viewed by visitor
